## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned


This was probably the second most difficult challenge I've done. I had never worked with 
```html
 <input type="range">
 ``` 
 so it was definitly a challenge to learn but nonetheless rewarding. I knew that ensuring browser compatibility  was important but with the slider I never knew how cruicial it was to incorporate every browser.
```css
.slider {}
.slider::-webkit-slider{}
.slider::-ms-track{} 
```



### Continued development

In the future I want to continue to incorporate JavaScript and improve on my animations when it comes to toggle, onlick and other actions. Not only that but I want to create functions that does not create redundancy and unnecessary lines of code.
